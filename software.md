- [Kinemetry](https://www.aip.de/en/members/davor-krajnovic/kinemetry/) - Kinemetry analyses 2D maps of the moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD), such as the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion. The method is a generalisation of surface photometry (e.g. [Jedrzejewski 1987](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987MNRAS.226..747J/abstract)) to all moments of the LOSVD. It performs harmonic expansion of 2D maps of observed moments (surface brightness, velocity, velocity dispersion, h3, h4...) along the best fitting ellipses (either fixed or free to change along the radii). Its purpose is to robustly quantify maps of the LOSVD moments, describe trends in structures and detect morphological and kinematic sub-components. Kinemetry can also be used for analysis of gas kinematics, in a similar way as classical tilted-ring analysis. This is because kinemetry, in the case of the velocity moment, assumes that motion is along circular orbits within a thin disk. More details about the method can be found in this paper [Krajnović et al. (2006, MNRAS, 366, 787)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.366..787K/abstract).

  The software was original written in IDL programming language, which you can download from [here](http://www.davor.krajnovic.org/software/). There is also a python version of the code, which is distributed via this [link](https://cloud.aip.de/index.php/s/ctByK9wHgKEWXLy).

This code has some new features such as variable domain decompositions (slab or pencil) for the Fast Fourier Transform in 3D, fully parallel random number generator and the realizations of random gaussian fluctuations in real space, rather than in Fourier space. Increasing levels of mass refinements can easily be generated in this way to almost unlimited number, provided that there are sufficiente computational MPI nodes.

### Extended Cosmologies

- [pyLDT-cosmo](https://github.com/mcataneo/pyLDT-cosmo) - A Python package to generate matter PDF predictions in Large Deviation Theory for ΛCDM and alternative cosmologies.

  Currently available cosmological models include:

  - ΛCDM
  - Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity with ΛCDM background (0705.1158)
  - nDGP gravity with ΛCDM background (0910.0235)

  pyLDT-cosmo is partly based on the Julia programming language, which uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to improve runtime performance. However, this feature comes at the expense of slow library loading when compared to pure or pre-compiled Python packages. On a modern computer pyLDT-cosmo takes about 80 seconds to load. After that computation is very efficient, taking only ~3 seconds to derive the matter PDF's simultaneuosly for all models, redshifts and smoothing radii.

- [nuCopter](https://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/Pert/README.html)

  1. We have modified the background cosmology class in Copter (J.Carlson, M. White and N. Padmanabhan, Phys. Rev. D80, 043531, 2009) to include the equation of state parameterization w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a) of M. Chevalier and D. Polarski, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 10, 213 (2001), and E.V. Linder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 091301 (2003). Resulting modifications to the growth are automatically included. This change applies to all of the perturbation theories covered by Copter.

  2. For Time-RG only, we have modified the Copter evolution equations to include neutrinos as a source for the growth of nonlinear CDM and baryon perturbations. This works by interpolating the transfer functions output by CAMB using a parameter file such as the one in our example. The method was described in M. Pietroni, JCAP 0810 (2008) 036, and J. Lesgourgues, et al., JCAP 0906 (2009) 017. The figure below shows our results for an early dark energy model with massive neutrinos.

  3. Our modified Copter requires omega_b = Omega_b h^2, omega_c, and omega_nu be provided as inputs, along with w0, wa, and the usual Copter inputs h, n, and Tcmb. Note that nonzero omega_nu with perturbation theories other than Time-RG is not supported.

  The particles are tracked through the atmosphere until they undergo reactions with the air nuclei or - in the case of instable secondaries - decay. The hadronic interactions at high energies may be described by several reaction models alternatively:The VENUS, QGSJET, and DPMJET models are based on the Gribov-Regge theory, while SIBYLL is a minijet model. The neXus model extends far above a simple combination of QGSJET and VENUS routines. The most recent EPOS model is based on the neXus framework but with important improvements concerning hard interactions and nuclear and high-density effect. HDPM is inspired by findings of the Dual Parton Model and tries to reproduce relevant kinematical distributions being measured at colliders.

- [CRPropa](https://crpropa.desy.de/) - CRPropa is a publicly available simulation framework to study the propagation of ultra-high-energy nuclei up to iron on their voyage through an (extra)galactic environment.

CRPropa can model the deflection in (inter)galactic magnetic fields, the propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos for a multitude of scenarios for different source distributions and magnetic environments. It enables the user to predict the spectra of UHECR (and of their secondaries), their composition and arrival direction distribution. Additionally, the low-energy Galactic propagation can be simulated by solving the transport equation using stochastic differential equations. CRPropa features a very flexible simulation setup with python steering and shared-memory parallelization.

  ![CRPropa](/images/pscan-home.png)

- [Dragon](https://github.com/cosmicrays) - DRAGON adopts a second-order Cranck-Nicholson scheme with Operator Splitting and time overrelaxation to solve the diffusion equation. This provides fast a solution that is enough accurate for the average user. Occasionally, users may want to have very accurate solutions to their problem. To enable this feature, users may get close to the accurate solution by using the fast method, and then switch to a more accurate solution scheme, featuring the Alternating-Direction-Implicit (ADI) Cranck-Nicholson scheme.

  Some parts of DRAGON are built following GALPROP, v50p. The first reason is that it is a waste of time to reimplement standard parts, like energy losses, in which nothing new has to be found. The second reason is that it is essential to be able to compare our predictions with that of the Galprop code, and this can be done only by following the details of its implementation. Therefore, we kept in the code some features and models used in Galprop, like nuclear cross-sections, the gas distribution, the convergence technique. However, each of these models is accompanied by other models, which can be selected by setting the appropriate switch. This is done very easily using the well known C++ structure of abstract/derived classes. The code is then very flexible and easy to manage and to modify or update.

- [GALPROP](https://galprop.stanford.edu/) - GALPROP is a numerical code for calculating the propagation of relativistic charged particles and the diffuse emissions produced during their propagation.

Each run of the code is governed by a configuration file allowing the user to specify and control many details of the calculation. Thus, each run of the code corresponds to a potentially different ``model''. The code itself continues to be developed and is available to the scientific community via this website.

The code can be run on essentially all supercomputer systems presently in use, including clusters of workstations or individual PCs.

  GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm (optionally in combination with a particle-mesh scheme for long-range gravitational forces) and represents fluids by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The code can be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations that include the cosmological expansion of space, both with or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-gravitating collisionless N-body system, and allows gas dynamics to be optionally included. Both the force computation and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive, with a dynamic range which is, in principle, unlimited.

  GADGET can therefore be used to address a wide array of astrophysically interesting problems, ranging from colliding and merging galaxies, to the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe. With the inclusion of additional physical processes such as radiative cooling and heating, GADGET can also be used to study the dynamics of the gaseous intergalactic medium, or to address star formation and its regulation by feedback processes.

The Poisson equation for self-gravity of the gas and dark matter is solved using geometric multigrid method. The approach to AMR in Nyx uses a nested hierarchy of logically-rectangular grids with simultaneous refinement of the grids in both space and time. The integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach the same time as the coarse grids and the data at different levels are then synchronized. A separate synchronization is done for gravity.

### Stellar Modelling

- [ESTER (Evolution STEllaire en Rotation)](http://ester-project.github.io/ester/) - The ambition of this project is to set out a two-dimensional stellar evolution code, which fully takes into account the effects of rotation, at any rate and in a self-consistent way.

  The difficult, but important point is that rotating stars are spheroidal and are never in hydrostatic equilibrium. They are pervaded by flows everywhere, even in the stably stratified radiative regions. These flows are essentially convective flows in thermally unstable regions (convection zones) and baroclinic flows in the radiative regions. These latter flows are grosso modo a differential rotation and a meridional circulation, with likely some small-scale turbulence. Radiative regions of non-rotating stars experience very little mixing (only due to microscopic phenomena). Rotation induces flows and therefore some mixing, well-known as "rotational mixing". This is a key feature of the evolution of rotating stars. Besides, these stars also oscillate, and astronomers would like to get from the oscillation frequencies some good constraints on the structure of these stars. The foregoing reasons and many others motivated us to construct a two-dimensional model of rotating stars that is kind enough to enlight us on the numerous questions we are wondering about...

- [GYRE](https://github.com/rhdtownsend/gyre) - GYRE is a stellar oscillation code. Given an input stellar model, GYRE calculates the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions for the normal oscillation modes of the model.

- [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/) - MESA was primarily developed through the concerted efforts of Bill Paxton over a 10 year period with the engagement and deep involvement of many theoretical and computational astrophysicists. MESA is currently developed and supported by a globally distributed team.

  Over the past decade, MESA has grown into an international community resource. The public availability of MESA has, and will continue, to serve education, scientific research, and outreach. We therefore consider it important to re-express the guiding principles for using and contributing to MESA. Our goal is to assure the greatest usefulness for the largest number of research and educational projects.

PDFs encode the flavour and momentum structure of composite particles, such as protons, pions and nuclei; most cross-section calculations are based on parton-level matrix-elements which must be connected to the real interacting particles, hence PDFs are an essential ingredient of phenomenological and experimental studies at hadron and heavy-ion colliders (e.g. LHC, HERA, Tevatron, EIC, FCC) and in cosmic-ray physics.

  PDFs themselves are fitted to a range of data by various collaborations. LHAPDF provides the definitive community library of such fits, in a standard data-format, as well as C++ and Python interfaces for evaluating them. Written as a general purpose C++ interpolator for estimating PDFs from discretised data files, it has also found more general uses, such as for fragmentation functions (essentially the inverse of PDFs).

- [PDFflow](https://pdfflow.readthedocs.io/) - PDFflow is a parton distribution function interpolation library written in Python and based on the TensorFlow framework. It is developed with a focus on speed and efficiency, enabling researchers to perform very expensive calculation as quick and easy as possible.

- [flavio](https://flav-io.github.io/) - a Python package to compute observables in flavour physics, electroweak precision tests, Higgs physics, and other precision tests of the Standard Model, both in the Standard Model and in the presence of new physics encoded in Wilson coefficients of dimension-6 operators.

### Spectrum Generators

- [ALAMODE](https://github.com/ttadano/alamode) - ALAMODE is a scientific software designed for analyzing lattice anharmonicity and lattice thermal conductivity of solids. By using an external DFT package such as VASP and Quantum ESPRESSO, you can extract harmonic and anharmonic force constants straightforwardly with ALAMODE. Using the calculated anharmonic force constants, you can also estimate lattice thermal conductivity, phonon linewidth, and other anharmonic phonon properties from first principles.

- [LMAPper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spm-and-mol-viewer/) - This application lets STM or AFM images AND molecular models to be overlaid. It is useful to understand how your molecules fit to what you observed and can help interpret your data. What makes this application more useful than paint programs (powerpoint or inkscape) is the fact that the size of the images and of the molecule is fixed, so that you know that you are working in real space.

- [Spheno](https://spheno.hepforge.org/) - SPheno stands for S(upersymmetric) Pheno(menology). The code calculates the SUSY spectrum using low energy data and a user supplied high scale model as input. The spectrum is used to calculate two- and three body decay modes of supersymmetric particle as well as of Higgs bosons. In addition the production cross sections for supersymmetric particle and Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- annihilation is calculated. Moreover, the branching of the decay $b \to s \gamma$, the SUSY contribution to anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as well as the SUSY contributions to the rho parameter due to sfermions are calculated. The code is written in F90 with an emphasis on easy generalisability. The structure is set such that complex phases as well as the extension to include the flavour structure can be done in a straight forward way. The 2-loop renormalization group equations as well as the one-loop finite corrections a la Bagger, Matchev, Pierce and Zhang are included. In addition the two-loop corrections to the neutral Higgs boson masses (a la Brignole, Degrassi, Slavich and Zwirner) and to the mu-parameter (a la Dedes and Slavich) are included. Starting with version 2.2.2 the SUSY Les Houches Accord is supported as well as the SPA conventions (for details see hep-ph/0511344).

- [SoftSUSY](https://softsusy.hepforge.org/) - SOFTSUSY is a program for calculating the supersymmetric spectrum in the MSSM or NMSSM (with or without R-parity violation) from input Standard Model fermion mass/mixings and electroweak/strong coupling data. The R-parity violating mode can calculate neutrino masses and mixings to 1 loop. SOFTSUSY can be used in conjunction with other programs for many different particle physics calculations: see a SUSY tools review.

- [SuSpect](http://suspect.in2p3.fr/) - This code calculates the SUSY and Higgs particle spectrum in the unconstrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), as well as in constrained models (cMSSMs) such as the minimal Supergravity (mSUGRA), the gauge mediated (GMSB) and anomaly mediated (AMSB) Supersymmetry breaking scenarii. All important features and ingredients are included:

  - renormalization group evolution between low and high energy scales,
  - consistent implementation of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking,
  - calculation of the physical particle masses with radiative corrections.

- [ISAJET](http://www.nhn.ou.edu/~isajet/) - ISAJET is a Monte Carlo program which simulates p p, pbar p, and e+ e- interactions at high energies. It is based on perturbative QCD plus phenomenological models for parton and beam jet fragmentation. Link to documentation can be found [here](http://www.nhn.ou.edu/~isajet/isajet788.pdf).

- [TOP++](https://www.precision.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/top-plus-plus/) - The program calculates the total inclusive cross-section for top-pair production at hadron colliders like the Tevatron and LHC. The program is capable of calculating the cross-section in fixed order QCD with exact NNLO. The program can also perform full NNLL soft gluon resummation. The resummation is done in Mellin space and then inverted numerically to x-space via the so-called Minimal Prescription.

- [UmUTracker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/umutracker/) - We present a versatile and fast MATLAB program (UmUTracker) that automatically detects and tracks particles by analyzing long video sequences acquired by either light microscopy or digital holography microscopy (DHM). Our program finds the 2D particle center position using an isosceles triangle transform and the axial position by a fast implementation of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld numerical reconstruction algorithm using a one dimensional radial intensity profile.

### Model Building

- [CIF2Cell](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cif2cell/) - CIF2Cell is a tool to generate the geometrical setup for various electronic structure codes from a CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) file. The program currently supports output for a number of popular electronic structure programs, including ABINIT, ASE, CASTEP, CP2K, CPMD, CRYSTAL09, Elk, EMTO, Exciting, Fleur, FHI-aims, Hutsepot, MOPAC, Quantum Espresso, RSPt, Siesta, SPR-KKR, VASP. Also exports some related formats like .coo, .cfg and .xyz-files. The program has been published in Computer Physics Communications 182 (2011) 1183–1186. Please cite generously.

- [SARAH](https://sarah.hepforge.org/) - SARAH is a Mathematica package for building and analyzing SUSY and non-SUSY models. It calculates all vertices, mass matrices, tadpoles equations, one-loop corrections for tadpoles and self-energies, and two-loop RGEs for a given model. SARAH writes model files for FeynArts, CalcHep/CompHep, which can also be used for dark matter studies using MicrOmegas, the UFO format which is supported by MadGraph 5 and for WHIZARD and OMEGA.  
  SARAH was also the first available spectrum-generator-generator: based on derived analytical expressions it creates source code for SPheno. It is therefore possible to implement new models in SPheno without the need to write any Fortran code by hand. The output for Vevacious can be used to check for the global minimum for a given model and parameter point.  
  Running SARAH is fast, it already includes a long list of SUSY and non-SUSY models, and the implementation of new models is efficient and straightforward.

- [Sym2int](https://renatofonseca.net/sym2int) - Extensions of the Standard Model (SM) might involve a different gauge group and/or new fields; in either case, it is important to understand what is the most general Lagrangian invariant under the symmetries of the model. However, sometimes one might forget to write down some valid interactions, and/or even end up writing some interactions which do not exist. Automatizing the process might help to reduce such mistakes.

  This page describes the Mathematica code Sym2Int (Symmetries to Interactions) which lists all valid interactions given the model's gauge group and fields (specified by their gauge and Lorentz representations). The program is valid for renormalizable interactions (mass dimension ≤4
  ) as well as the ones which are not renormalizable (mass dimension >4
  ). Since version 2, terms with derivatives and gauge bosons are also accounted for. More details can be found below.

### Susyno

- [Susyno](https://renatofonseca.net/susyno) is a Mathematica package which calculates the 2-loop renormalisation group equations of generic supersymmetric models, based on any gauge group (the only exception being multiple U(1) groups) and with any field content.

### Effective Field Theories

The likelihood includes contributions from quark and lepton flavour physics, electroweak precision tests, and other precision observables.

  The package is based on flavio for the calculation of observables and statistical treatment and wilson for the running, translation, and matching of Wilson coefficients.

### Feyn Family

- [FeynRules](https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/) - FeynRules is a Mathematica® package that allows the calculation of Feynman rules in momentum space for any QFT physics model. The user needs to provide FeynRules with the minimal information required to describe the new model, contained in the so-called model-file. This information is then used to calculate the set of Feynman rules associated with the Lagrangian. The Feynman rules calculated by the code can then be used to implement the new physics model into other existing tools, such as MC generators. This is done via a set of interfaces which are developed together and maintained by the corresponding MC authors.

- [FeynArts](http://www.feynarts.de/) - FeynArts is a Mathematica package for the generation and visualization of Feynman diagrams and amplitudes.

- [LoopTools](http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/) - LoopTools is a package for evaluation of scalar and tensor one-loop integrals based on the [FF package by G.J. van Oldenborgh](http://gjvo.home.xs4all.nl/FF.html). It features an easy Fortran, C++, and Mathematica interface to the scalar one-loop functions of FF and in addition provides the 2-, 3-, and 4-point tensor coefficient functions.

### Statistics

- [pyhf](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf) - The HistFactory p.d.f. template [[CERN-OPEN-2012-016](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1456844)] is per-se independent of its implementation in ROOT and sometimes, it’s useful to be able to run statistical analysis outside of ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework.

  This repo is a pure-python implementation of that statistical model for multi-bin histogram-based analysis and its interval estimation is based on the asymptotic formulas of “Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics” [[arXiv:1007.1727](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1727)]. The aim is also to support modern computational graph libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow in order to make use of features such as autodifferentiation and GPU acceleration.

- [blueice](https://github.com/JelleAalbers/blueice) - This package allows you to do parametric inference using likelihood functions, in particular likelihoods derived from Monte-Carlo or calibration sources.

  Especially when connected to a Monte Carlo, blueice lets you make likelihood functions which measure agreement between data and theory with flexibility: you choose which settings to vary (which parameters the likelihood functions has) and in which space the agreement is measured.

  This package contains only generic code: you'll need a few things to make it useful for a particular experiment. Originally this code was developed for XENON1T only; the XENON1T models have since been split off to the [laidbax](https://github.com/XENON1T/laidbax) repository.
